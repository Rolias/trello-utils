Greenlit Cards	Kubernetes for Developers (Dan Wahlin)	Hey Jason!---- ----Hope you had a great Christmas/New Year break!---- ----Now that the Angular Architecture course is wrapped up I wanted to run some ideas by you for the next course. I’ve been polling people in my classes, in workshops, at conferences, and even online and was surprised with what the #1 suggestion was: Kubernetes for Developers. People have really liked my Docker for Developers course (so I’m told anyway 😊) and want something similar for Kubernetes. That class was unanimously at the top of suggestions I received from a variety of people.----So, here are a few ideas for you: ----**Kubernetes for Developers**--This course wouldn’t duplicate what’s out there. Like the Docker for Developers course it would teach specific Kubernetes concepts but from a developer perspective – there’s definitely a demand for this out there based on what I’m seeing/hearing. Here are a few questions I get from devs that relate to it:----As a developer that works with containers, should I spend time learning Kubernetes?--How do I move my Docker Compose files (and ultimately containers) into Kubernetes to simulate production?--How do I get my app running locally in Kubernetes (with Docker Desktop) so I can run it as if it’s in production?--How do I work with secrets and other sensitive data in a Kubernetes environment?-- ----**Kubernetes: First Look**--Interested in doing this or really any course on Kubernetes that would fit into a Kubernetes learning path. It’s a SUPER popular technology right now and people have asked me why there’s not more content out there on Pluralsight.----**React Architecture and Best Practices**--Now that the Angular Architecture class is done, people on Twitter who know it’s coming have asked if I’ll be doing something similar for React or Vue.js. There are a ton of courses on those technologies out there (Pluralsight and others), but this type of course is nowhere to be found which is why I think it’d be in high demand.----**Vue.js Architecture and Best Practices**--Same as above but for Vue.js----Working with Docker and Kubernetes in VS Code--Needs a better title, but this would be focused on using the VS Code extensions for Docker and Kubernetes and showing how they can increase productivity (especially good for people who aren’t as good at the command line).---- ----On a side note, now that the Angular Architecture course is (almost) out I expect other authors to take that idea and want to apply it to React/Vue.js as I listed above. If that comes up I’d really appreciate you letting me know and giving me the opportunity to do the course (since it was my original idea). 😊----Let me know if any of those interest you. The Kubernetes for Developers course would be at the top of my list and I’m confident (based on feedback and the overall state of containers right now) that it would be very popular and wanted especially by enterprises using Pluralsight.	2019-02-22T13:02:53.440Z	Jake Druecke	Ryan Hansen	Jason Salmond
Greenlit Cards	GraphQL: The Big Pictue (Adhithi Ravichandran)	Hi Jason,----Hope you are enjoying your holidays. I just wanted to send my thoughts on potential topics for the next course. No rush, we can evaluate them after the holidays. I just wanted to send them your way when I get a chance.----I picked these courses since they are trending, and we don't have them on the Pluralsight library.----**1.  GraphQL  -The Big Picture/ GraphQL Fundamentals.**--This will be a good one for a big picture overview of graphql and its fundamentals. We currently have two courses that use graphql but don't have a overview/introduction course.----**2. Integrating React applications with GraphQL using Apollo. **-- Most modern tech stack today. This will focus on building a React application using Apollo graphql.----**3. Full Stack React Native application integerated with GraphQL (This was hard to come up with a title, we can change the title based on Pluralsight's recommendation)**----Gist of the course: --Build a react native application from start to finish with integration to back-end using graphql.----**4. Testing React Native Applications**--This will focus on testing aspects using Jest and Detox.------**5. Building a complete React Native app. **----This would be a course focused on building a complete React Native app from start to finish with latest libraries and practces. Will include integration with touch/Face ID authentication, and other cool stuff.------Let me know when you get a chance what you think, and I think these are good candidates to talk about with curriculum.----Please let me know if you have any questions.----Thanks,--Adhithi	2019-02-22T17:00:00.000Z	Hampton Paulk	Jason Salmond

Deal Desk Cards	Introduction to TDD in C# (Mark Seemann)	The overall message is that most people write unit tests with an abundance of mocks and stubs, which tends to make the tests brittle.----Refactoring a code base towards a more functional design (hence, pure functions) has many benefits, one of which is that the unit tests get more robust. The course would show, using C#, how the ‘normal’ way of doing things leads to brittle tests, how to refactor to a more functional design, and how that enables you to write better tests.----You probably need more details, but I thought I’d just start with this email before I sunk too much effort into it	2019-02-27T23:00:00.000Z	Ashton Jensen	David Berry

Follow up Required	RxJS in Angular: Data Wrangling (Deborah Kurata)	**Note from Deborah:**----I'm on module 11 of 12 on the redo of my "Angular Routing" course and would like to start a conversation about doing an "RxJS for Angular Developers" course as we discussed several months ago:----"How about a course on RxJS for Angular developers? Title would be something like "RxJS in Angular". Or if it has to be in one of the predefined buckets: "RxJS in Angular Playbook".--I know someone else is working on a Fundamentals course and I think someone is working on an "operators" course which I can reference. But there are some standard ways to work with RxJS with Angular that won't be included in any of the JavaScript-based RxJS courses."	2019-04-16T04:00:00.000Z	Jason Salmond	Hampton Paulk

Follow up Required	Getting Started With Storybook.js (Nate Taylor)	The advent of Bootstrap enabled a new experience for developers. It provided them with a library they could use to get a consistent look and feel of pure HTML components, without purchasing an expensive 3rd party tool and without taking a lot of time to get up and running.  With the rise of React and Angular, more and more teams are creating their own custom component libraries. These libraries will create complex components by composing them from smaller, more basic components.----The challenge becomes how to show all of the components that a team is working with. An early solution has been to use a living style guide that shows the available styles for a team. However, tools such as StorybookJS enable a different work flow.----Storybook bills itself as “a UI development environment and playground for UI Components.” It allows developers to create components and display them in a way that allows interaction. For example, a team could develop a custom widget and inside of Storybook they could interact with that widget to see how it behaves.----More than that, Storybook allows developers to show how to use the component. For example, what properties need to be set, or what is the shape of the data that is needed, and how could they include that component in their application.----Finally, Storybook has a plug-in architecture, which allows the community to develop plugins. For example, a team using React could use a redux-like store plugin that would simulate a data-backed component.----This course will walk the user through why they’d use storybook, how to get started, and how to add components.  It will also show them how to include plugins as well as some of the top plugins that can be used.	2019-02-27T13:03:16.947Z	Jason Salmond	Hampton Paulk
Follow up Required	Building a GraphQL Server with Node.js and Express (Jonathan Mills)	**From Jonathan**----I would love to do a course  "Building a GraphQL Server with Node.js and Express" that will compliment and sit along side the "Building Web Applications" and "Building RESTful APIs" courses I already have out there.--Basically it will take the same approach as the other two courses--I think it would fit very nicely on the Node.js path as it will be very node specific and not on the GraphQL path that may need to be more broad.	2019-02-28T13:04:00.000Z	Jason Salmond	Hampton Paulk
