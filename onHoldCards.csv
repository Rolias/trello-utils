Managed Services Engine Fundamentals - (Aaron Skonnard)	https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/mse-fundamentals	----ID: mse-fundamentals----This course is about a product that Microsoft no longer supports and is out of date anyway.  Most people use API gateways for this sort of functionality today and this course is really directed at SOA, so the landscape of how we do this has changes.----Course also is off brand and uses the old, old logo.----Audio is spotty and has a lot of background noise in places----Course has been averaging < 8 hours of viewing for the last 3 quarters
Introduction to ASP.NET MVC3 - (Scott Allen)	https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/aspdotnet-mvc3-intro/table-of-contents	--**PUBLIC**--Reason for retirement:--- Course is on an olde version of MVC and instructs users to download VS2010--- Uses old branding (Green slides)--- Wrong Aspect Ratio--- Audio is terrible----This course is in the free slice.

Real World ASP.NET MVC3 - (Rob Conery)	https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/real-world-aspdotnet-mvc3/table-of-contents	----**PUBLIC**--Reason for retirement:--- Course is about an old version of ASP.NET MVC--- Course is off brand--- Course has low viewership (60 hours a quarter)----We have multiple ASP.NET MVC5 fundamentals courses that would serve as a replacement, for example, Scott Allen's ASP.NET MVC5 Fundamentals----**PRIVATE**--This course is all over the place.  It isn't just talking about building apps, but about founding a startup and making business decisions.  It also veers into JavaScript by talking about Backbone.js and then third party service options for e-Commerce.  It is just all over the place and something we would not commission today.  Since it is on old versions of everything, we just need to take it out of the library.  We have plenty of good coverage on ASP.NET MVC even without this course.--

ASP.NET MVC 3.0 Fundamentals  - (Scott Allen)	https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/aspdotnet-mvc3/table-of-contents	----**PUBLIC**--Reason for retirement:--- Old version of MVC--- Old Branding (Green Slides)--- Old Aspect Ratio----This course is still getting about 1300 hours of viewing per quarter, which is a little scary because this is a few versions of MVC ago.
